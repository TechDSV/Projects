# Project Management Software

Nowadays, many businesses and organisations are becoming more aware of the importance of technological factors in all aspects of life. This situation has resulted in the increasing need for different software products and services that cannot be created successfully without a proper software project management plan.

Whether you’re currently an experienced software project manager, an ambitious team member in a software project, or still very much in the dark about it, this article will offer something helpful for you.

## Overview of Software Project Management
Project management refers to the process of applying skills, knowledge, techniques, and tools to to fulfil the requirements of the project. It usually broke down into project management phases, including project initiation, project planning, project execution, project monitoring, and project closure.

Actually, it refers to the branch of project management that involves planning, scheduling, allocating resources, executing, tracking, and delivering specific software and other IT-related projects within the minimum possible consumption of resources, time, and money.

## Building a software project management plan
As shown above, planning is one of the five project management steps. It needs a project plan to give direction for the whole team in terms of product scope, resource and material required, quality outputs, potential risks management, costs throughout the project.

### 1. Performing requirement gathering
The first step in building a software project management plan is requirement gathering. It is about the exploratory research and documentation of the customers’ project requirements to provide them with what they want. The requirements gathering process can conduct at the very beginning of the software project.

Indeed, there are multiple ways to gather requirements. Software project managers can utilise methods such as conducting a pre-workshop survey, adopting the nominal group technique, organising brainstorming sessions, or having one-on-one talks with those involved.

### 2. Planning for software project risks
The project risks can unexpected and rampant, ranging from insufficient time and budget. Unrealistic stakeholders’ expectations to software quality standards and human resource issues. Besides, the risk response plan plays a vital role in risk management since it contains the list of identified risks. Their impacts and the measures to address them.

### 3. Building a software project quality plan
As can be seen in the Iron Triangle below, three triangle’s sides correspond to three constraints. Any change in one constraint will make the two remaining ones change. Project quality refers to the project’s deliverables and ability to meet the specified and implied requirements. There are three interrelated constraints (project scope, cost, and time) that determine the quality of a project.

You can suppose to determine the project scope connected with the cost and required schedule. Then you need to examine the expenses needed for the achievement of the expected quality level. Moreover, it would help if you had a quality assurance or defect prevention plan. Which is one of the most necessary things of any software project.

### 4. Selecting software project team members
To determine all necessary resources for the project, you can consult those experienced in software and IT-related products. You can also refer to the resource database in your company. It will scan the resources and know people’s skill sets.

A software project is a collaborative activity performed by people, and they are those in your project team. You need a project team for planning, estimating, execution, and project completion.

### 5. Creating software project time estimates
The software project manager is also responsible for creating the time estimate as accurately as possible. A reasonable time estimate will help you be more prepared for any risks, development delays. And time-consuming tasks so that the whole project can be implemented straightforwardly to the completion. 

Creating a correct time estimate of how long the project will last is a time-consuming and challenging task. However, a work breakdown structure (WBS) and a project network diagram (PND). It helps to detail what should be conducted by both the project manager and the project team for the project completion.

### 6. Estimating software project cost
A critical phase in software project management planning is recognising. And understanding how much a project will cost for you to commit the funds. An accurate budget estimate should include the following: product and project scope, time frame, assumptions, constraints, variance range. 

Cost estimation helps the project manager explain all real costs to a stakeholder about a correct ballpark figure for the project. Remember that poor cost estimates win little trust from the stakeholders. Some companies don’t have specific policy guidance on cost estimates. While others will offer some guidelines, to which you should conform.
